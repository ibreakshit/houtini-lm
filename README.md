I built this because I kept leaving Claude Code running overnight on big refactors and the token bill was painful. A huge chunk of that spend goes on bounded tasks any decent model handles fine - generating boilerplate, code review, commit messages, format conversion. Stuff that doesn't need Claude's reasoning or tool access.

Houtini LM connects Claude Code to a local LLM on your network - or any OpenAI-compatible API (LM Studio, Ollama, vLLM, DeepSeek, Groq, Cerebras, and OpenRouter's 300+ models through one endpoint). Claude keeps doing the hard work - architecture, planning, multi-file changes - and offloads the grunt work to whatever cheaper model you've got running. No Claude quota burn. No rate limits. Private if local, cheap if cloud. The trade is wall-clock time: local inference is typically 3-30× slower than frontier models, so delegation wins on bounded, self-contained tasks rather than everything.

I wrote a [full walkthrough of why I built this and how I use it day to day](https://houtini.com/how-to-cut-your-claude-code-bill-with-houtini-lm/).

## How it works

```
Claude Code (orchestrator)
   |
   |-- Complex reasoning, planning, architecture --> Claude API (your tokens)
   |
   +-- Bounded grunt work --> houtini-lm --HTTP/SSE--> Your local LLM (free)
       . Boilerplate & test stubs          Qwen, Llama, Nemotron, GLM...
       . Code review & explanations        LM Studio, Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp
       . Commit messages & docs            DeepSeek, Groq, Cerebras (cloud)
       . Format conversion
       . Mock data & type definitions
       . Embeddings for RAG pipelines
```

Claude's the architect. Your local model's the drafter. Claude QAs everything.

## Quick start

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add houtini-lm -- npx -y @houtini/lm
```

That's it. If LM Studio's running on `localhost:1234` (the default), Claude can start delegating straight away.

### LLM on a different machine

I've got a GPU box on my local network running Qwen 3 Coder Next in LM Studio. If you've got a similar setup, point the URL at it:

```bash
claude mcp add houtini-lm -e HOUTINI_LM_ENDPOINT_URL=http://192.168.1.50:1234 -- npx -y @houtini/lm
```

### Cloud APIs

Works with anything speaking the OpenAI format. DeepSeek at twenty-eight cents per million tokens, Groq for speed, Cerebras if you want three thousand tokens per second - whatever you fancy:

```bash
claude mcp add houtini-lm \
  -e HOUTINI_LM_ENDPOINT_URL=https://api.deepseek.com \
  -e HOUTINI_LM_API_KEY=your-key-here \
  -- npx -y @houtini/lm
```

### OpenRouter

OpenRouter gives you 300+ models through one endpoint. Auto-detected from the URL — attribution headers, `reasoning.exclude`, and retry-with-backoff all kick in automatically:

```bash
claude mcp add houtini-lm \
  -e HOUTINI_LM_ENDPOINT_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api \
  -e HOUTINI_LM_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-... \
  -e HOUTINI_LM_MODEL=nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free \
  -- npx -y @houtini/lm
```

### Claude Desktop

Drop this into your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "houtini-lm": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@houtini/lm"],
      "env": {
        "HOUTINI_LM_ENDPOINT_URL": "http://localhost:1234"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Model discovery

This is where things get interesting. At startup, houtini-lm queries your LLM server for every model available - loaded and downloaded - then looks each one up on HuggingFace's free API to pull metadata: architecture, licence, download count, pipeline type. All of that gets cached in a local SQLite database (`~/.houtini-lm/model-cache.db`) so subsequent startups are instant.

The result is that houtini-lm actually knows what your models are good at. Not just the name - the capabilities, the strengths, what tasks to send where. If you've got Nemotron loaded but a Qwen Coder sitting idle, it'll flag that. If someone on a completely different setup loads a Mistral model houtini-lm has never seen before, the HuggingFace lookup auto-generates a profile for it.

Run `list_models` and you get the full picture:

```
Loaded models (ready to use):

  nvidia/nemotron-3-nano
    type: llm, arch: nemotron_h_moe, quant: Q4_K_M, format: gguf
    context: 200,082 (max 1,048,576), by: nvidia
    Capabilities: tool_use
    NVIDIA Nemotron: compact reasoning model optimised for step-by-step logic
    Best for: analysis tasks, code bug-finding, math/science questions
    HuggingFace: text-generation, 1.7M downloads, MIT licence

Available models (downloaded, not loaded):

  qwen3-coder-30b-a3b-instruct
    type: llm, arch: qwen3moe, quant: BF16, context: 262,144
    Qwen3 Coder: code-specialised model with agentic capabilities
    Best for: code generation, code review, test stubs, refactoring
    HuggingFace: text-generation, 12.9K downloads, Apache-2.0
```

For models we know well - Qwen, Nemotron, Granite, LLaMA, GLM, GPT-OSS - there's a curated profile built in with specific strengths and weaknesses. For everything else, the HuggingFace lookup fills the gaps. Cache refreshes every 7 days. Zero friction - `sql.js` is pure WASM, no native dependencies, no build tools needed.

## What gets offloaded

**Delegate to the local model** - bounded, well-defined tasks:

| Task | Why it works locally |
|------|---------------------|
| Generate test stubs | Clear input (source), clear output (tests) |
| Explain a function | Summarisation doesn't need tool access |
| Draft commit messages | Diff in, message out |
| Code review | Paste full source, ask for bugs |
| Convert formats | JSON to YAML, snake_case to camelCase |
| Generate mock data | Schema in, data out |
| Write type definitions | Source in, types out |
| Structured JSON output | Grammar-constrained, guaranteed valid |
| Text embeddings | Semantic search, RAG pipelines |
| Brainstorm approaches | Doesn't commit to anything |

**Keep on Claude** - anything that needs reasoning, tool access, or multi-step orchestration:

- Architectural decisions
- Reading/writing files
- Running tests and interpreting results
- Multi-file refactoring plans
- Anything that needs to call other tools

The tool descriptions are written to nudge Claude into planning delegation at the start of large tasks, not just using it when it happens to think of it.

## Performance tracking

Every response includes a footer with real performance data — computed from the SSE stream, not from any proprietary API:

```
---
Model: nvidia/nemotron-3-nano | 279→303 tokens (12 reasoning / 291 visible) | TTFT: 485ms, 58.0 tok/s, 5.2s
📊 First measured call on nvidia/nemotron-3-nano: 58.0 tok/s, 485ms to first token — use this to gauge whether to delegate longer tasks.
💰 Claude quota saved — this session: 4,283 tokens / 7 calls · lifetime: 147,432 tokens / 213 calls
```

The 📊 line only appears on the first measured call per model per session — it's a real benchmark from a genuine task, not a synthetic warmup. The 💰 line updates every call.

When the active model returns `completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens` (DeepSeek R1, LM Studio with "Separate reasoning_content" enabled, OpenAI reasoning models), the token block splits into `reasoning / visible` so you can see when a thinking model is burning its output budget on hidden reasoning.

### Lifetime persistence

Per-model performance and token counts persist across Claude Desktop restarts in `~/.houtini-lm/model-cache.db`. This means:

- From call 1 of a new session, `discover` shows **historical** tok/s and TTFT for the loaded model — not "not yet benchmarked".
- The 💰 counter shows both session and lifetime totals.
- The `code_task_files` pre-flight estimator uses measured per-model prefill rate to refuse obviously-too-large inputs with a clear diagnostic, instead of letting them silently hang against the MCP client timeout.

The data is workstation-specific — that's intentional. Routing decisions should reflect your actual hardware, not a synthetic benchmark.

The `discover` tool shows per-model averages across both scopes:

```
Measured speed (session):  58.0 tok/s · TTFT 485ms (1 call)
Measured speed (lifetime on this workstation): 46.9 tok/s · TTFT 2641ms (214 calls, last used 2026-04-20)
```

In practice, Claude delegates more aggressively the longer a session runs. After about 5,000 offloaded tokens, it starts hunting for more work to push over. Reinforcing loop.

## Model routing

If you've got multiple models loaded (or downloaded), houtini-lm picks the best one for each task automatically. Each model family has per-family prompt hints - temperature, output constraints, and think-block flags - so GLM gets told "no preamble, no step-by-step reasoning" while Qwen Coder gets a low temperature for focused code output.

The routing scores loaded models against the task type (code, chat, analysis, embedding). If the best loaded model isn't ideal for the task, you'll see a suggestion in the response footer pointing to a better downloaded model. No runtime model swapping - model loading takes minutes, so houtini-lm suggests rather than blocks.

Supported model families with curated prompt hints: GLM-4, Qwen3 Coder, Qwen3, LLaMA 3, Nemotron, Granite, GPT-OSS, Nomic Embed. Unknown models get sensible defaults.

### Overriding the router

Scoring works well when there are a handful of loaded models. On providers with large catalogues (OpenRouter lists 300+ models, all reporting as routable) unknown models all score zero and ties break on iteration order, so you probably want to pin explicitly. Two ways, in precedence order:

1. **Per-call** — pass `model: "nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free"` to any of `chat` / `custom_prompt` / `code_task` / `code_task_files`. Overrides everything else.
2. **Per-process** — set `HOUTINI_LM_MODEL` in the environment. Applies to every tool call from that server process. Overridden by the per-call parameter.

Leave both unset and the router picks.

## Tools

### `chat`

The workhorse. Send a task, get an answer. The description includes planning triggers that nudge Claude to identify offloadable work when it's starting a big task.

| Parameter | Required | Default | What it does |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `message` | yes | - | The task. Be specific about output format. |
| `system` | no | - | Persona - "Senior TypeScript dev" not "helpful assistant" |
| `temperature` | no | 0.3 | 0.1 for code, 0.3 for analysis, 0.7 for creative |
| `max_tokens` | no | *auto* | Defaults to 25% of the loaded model's context window (fallback 16,384). Pass a number to cap it. |
| `json_schema` | no | - | Force structured JSON output conforming to a schema |
| `model` | no | *auto-route* | Pin a specific model id (e.g. `nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free` on OpenRouter). Overrides routing and `HOUTINI_LM_MODEL`. Useful on providers with many candidates. |

### `custom_prompt`

Three-part prompt: system, context, instruction. Keeping them separate prevents context bleed - consistently outperforms stuffing everything into one message, especially with local models. I tested this properly one weekend - took the same batch of review tasks and ran them both ways. Splitting things into three parts won every round.

| Parameter | Required | Default | What it does |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `instruction` | yes | - | What to produce. Under 50 words works best. |
| `system` | no | - | Persona + constraints, under 30 words |
| `context` | no | - | Complete data to analyse. Never truncate. |
| `temperature` | no | 0.3 | 0.1 for review, 0.3 for analysis |
| `max_tokens` | no | *auto* | Defaults to 25% of the loaded model's context window (fallback 16,384). |
| `json_schema` | no | - | Force structured JSON output |
| `model` | no | *auto-route* | Pin a specific model id. Overrides routing and `HOUTINI_LM_MODEL`. |

### `code_task`

Built for code analysis. Pre-configured system prompt with temperature and output constraints tuned per model family via the routing layer.

| Parameter | Required | Default | What it does |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `code` | yes | - | Complete source code. Never truncate. |
| `task` | yes | - | "Find bugs", "Explain this", "Write tests" |
| `language` | no | - | "typescript", "python", "rust", etc. |
| `max_tokens` | no | *auto* | Defaults to 25% of the loaded model's context window (fallback 16,384). |
| `model` | no | *auto-route* | Pin a specific model id. Overrides routing and `HOUTINI_LM_MODEL`. |

### `code_task_files`

Like `code_task`, but the local LLM reads files directly from disk — source never passes through the MCP client's context window. Use this when reviewing multiple related files, or a single large file that's awkward to paste. Files are read in parallel with `Promise.allSettled`, so one unreadable file doesn't sink the call; failures are surfaced inline with the reason.

Includes a **pre-flight prefill estimator**: if measured per-model data from the SQLite cache shows the input would exceed the MCP client's ~60s request-timeout during prompt processing, the call is refused early with a concrete diagnostic (estimated prefill seconds, tokens, and sample-count) instead of letting it silently hang. First-time callers are never refused — the estimator only fires after ≥2 measured samples.

| Parameter | Required | Default | What it does |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `paths` | yes | - | Array of absolute file paths. Relative paths are rejected. |
| `task` | yes | - | "Find bugs across these files", "Audit this module" |
| `language` | no | - | "typescript", "python", "rust", etc. |
| `max_tokens` | no | *auto* | Defaults to 25% of the loaded model's context window (fallback 16,384). |
| `model` | no | *auto-route* | Pin a specific model id. Overrides routing and `HOUTINI_LM_MODEL`. |

### `embed`

Generate text embeddings via the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings` endpoint. Requires an embedding model to be available - Nomic Embed is a solid choice. Returns the vector, dimension count, and usage stats.

| Parameter | Required | Default | What it does |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `input` | yes | - | Text to embed |
| `model` | no | auto | Embedding model ID |

### `discover`

Health check and speed readout. Returns model name, context window, capability profile, connection latency (labelled explicitly — this is the `/v1/models` fetch round-trip, *not* inference speed), and the active model's measured tok/s and TTFT averaged over the session. Before any real call has run, measured speed shows as "not yet benchmarked — will be captured on the first real call" rather than inventing a number from a synthetic probe. Call before delegating if you're not sure the LLM's available, or when deciding whether a longer task is worth offloading.

### `list_models`

Lists everything on the LLM server - loaded and downloaded - with full metadata: architecture, quantisation, context window, capabilities, and HuggingFace enrichment data. Shows capability profiles describing what each model is best at, so Claude can make informed delegation decisions.

### `stats`

Compact markdown dump of your offload stats — session and lifetime totals, per-model performance history, reasoning-token overhead — without the model catalog that `discover` prints. Cheap to call repeatedly to watch the 💰 counter climb.

| Parameter | Required | Default | What it does |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `model` | no | - | Filter output to a single model ID. Omit for all models ever used on this workstation. |

Example output:

```
## Houtini LM stats
**Endpoint**: http://hopper:1234 (LM Studio)
**First call on this workstation**: 2026-04-14

### Totals
| Scope    | Calls | Prompt tokens | Completion tokens | Total tokens |
| Session  |     7 |         3,100 |             1,183 |        4,283 |
| Lifetime |   213 |             — |                 — |      147,432 |

### Per-model performance
| Model                    | Scope    | Calls | Avg TTFT | Avg tok/s | Prompt tokens | Last used  |
| nvidia/nemotron-3-nano   | session  |     7 |    485   |      58.0 | —             | —          |
| nvidia/nemotron-3-nano   | lifetime |   213 |   2641   |      46.9 |       89,320  | 2026-04-20 |

### Reasoning-token overhead (lifetime)
124 / 47,183 completion tokens spent on hidden reasoning (0.3%). Low — reasoning is effectively suppressed.
```

The reasoning-token overhead line is the canary for "is `reasoning_effort` actually being honoured on this model and this backend?" — above ~30% is a signal to investigate.

## Structured JSON output

Both `chat` and `custom_prompt` accept a `json_schema` parameter that forces the response to conform to a JSON Schema. LM Studio uses grammar-based sampling to guarantee valid output - no hoping the model remembers to close its brackets.

```json
{
  "json_schema": {
    "name": "code_review",
    "schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "issues": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "line": { "type": "number" },
              "severity": { "type": "string" },
              "description": { "type": "string" }
            },
            "required": ["line", "severity", "description"]
          }
        }
      },
      "required": ["issues"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Getting good results from local models

Qwen, Llama, Nemotron, GLM - they score brilliantly on coding benchmarks now. The gap between a good and bad result is almost always prompt quality, not model capability. I've spent a fair bit of time on this.

**Send complete code.** Local models hallucinate details when you give them truncated input. If a file's too large, send the relevant function - not a snippet with `...` in the middle.

**Be explicit about output format.** "Return a JSON array" or "respond in bullet points" - don't leave it open-ended. Smaller models need this.

**Set a specific persona.** "Expert Rust developer who cares about memory safety" gets noticeably better results than "helpful assistant."

**State constraints.** "No preamble", "reference line numbers", "max 5 bullet points" - tell the model what *not* to do as well as what to do.

**Include surrounding context.** For code generation, send imports, types, and function signatures - not just the function body.

**One call at a time.** As of v2.8.0, houtini-lm enforces this automatically with a request semaphore. Parallel calls queue up and run one at a time, so each gets the full timeout budget instead of stacking.

## Self-test (shakedown)

The canonical way to verify an install and get an honest read on what the loaded model can do on your hardware:

```bash
npm run shakedown
```

This runs [`shakedown.mjs`](./shakedown.mjs) — an end-to-end test that exercises all seven tools (`discover` → `list_models` → `chat` → `custom_prompt` → `code_task` → `code_task_files` → `embed`) and prints a summary table with real TTFT, tok/s, token counts, and reasoning-token split for each call. Takes under a minute on a decent rig.

Sample output tail:

```
Summary

```

Want a human-readable quality review rather than just latency numbers? Paste [SHAKEDOWN.md](./SHAKEDOWN.md) into a Claude session that has houtini-lm attached — Claude will drive the seven steps and write you a report on output quality as well as performance.

## Think-block handling

Thinking models burn part of their output budget on invisible reasoning before producing an answer. Left alone, small models at default `max_tokens` will happily spend the whole budget reasoning and return an empty body. How houtini-lm handles this depends on whether the provider exposes reasoning as a separate channel or in-band.

**Local backends (LM Studio, Ollama, vLLM)** — reasoning arrives inline on the content channel or via `delta.reasoning_content` / `delta.reasoning`:

1. **Suppression at source** — at startup, houtini-lm checks each model's HuggingFace chat template for thinking support. Models that support the `enable_thinking` toggle (Qwen3, Gemma 4, Nemotron, DeepSeek R1, GLM-4, gpt-oss) get thinking disabled at inference time. Detection is automatic via chat-template inspection plus arch/id heuristics, so Ollama tags like `qwen3:4b` are recognised too.
2. **Budget inflation** — `max_tokens` is silently inflated (×4 or +2000, whichever is bigger) so reasoning can't starve the content channel. Essential for backends like Ollama where the Qwen3 Jinja template hardcodes `enable_thinking=true` and ignores the API flag.
3. **Reasoning capture + stripping** — reasoning is captured from both `delta.reasoning_content` (LM Studio, DeepSeek R1, Nemotron) and `delta.reasoning` (Ollama). Inline `<think>...</think>` blocks on the content channel are stripped after assembly — balanced pairs, orphan openers, and orphan closers are all handled. When reasoning exhausts the budget entirely, the captured reasoning text is returned as a last-ditch fallback so the caller sees *something* rather than a silent empty body.

**OpenRouter** — handles reasoning as a structured per-request parameter and a separate `message.reasoning` response field. Houtini-lm sends `reasoning: { exclude: true }` on every OpenRouter call so thinking models (Nemotron, DeepSeek R1, Qwen3, Claude thinking, gpt-oss, etc.) are normalised to text-only output at the provider level. Budget inflation still fires because some upstream providers bill reasoning tokens against the cap before `exclude` filtering. No stripping is needed — the provider never sends the reasoning in the first place.

The quality footer flags `think-blocks-stripped` when stripping occurred, `reasoning-only` when the fallback fired, and `hit-max-tokens` when the budget ran out — so you know exactly what happened even when the output looks clean.

## Quality metadata

Every response includes structured quality signals in the footer so Claude (or any orchestrator) can make informed trust decisions:

```
---
Model: qwen3-coder-30b-a3b | 413→81 tokens | TTFT: 2355ms, 15.0 tok/s, 5.4s | Quality: think-blocks-stripped, tokens-estimated
💰 Claude quota saved this session: 494 tokens across 1 offloaded call
```

Flags include: `TRUNCATED` (partial result), `think-blocks-stripped`, `tokens-estimated` (usage data was missing, estimated from content length), `hit-max-tokens`. When no flags fire, the quality line is omitted — clean output, nothing to report.

## Session metrics resource

The `houtini://metrics/session` MCP resource exposes cumulative offload stats as JSON. Claude can read this proactively to make smarter delegation decisions based on actual session performance:

```json
{
  "session": {
    "totalCalls": 14,
    "promptTokens": 3200,
    "completionTokens": 5250,
    "totalTokensOffloaded": 8450
  },
  "perModel": {
    "qwen3-coder-30b-a3b": {
      "calls": 14,
      "avgTtftMs": 2100,
      "avgTokPerSec": 15.2
    }
  }
}
```

## Request serialisation

On **local** providers (LM Studio, Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp) parallel MCP tool calls are automatically queued and run one at a time. A single-GPU host can only serve one request at a time anyway — without the semaphore, parallel calls stack timeouts and waste the generation budget.

On **remote** providers (OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Groq, Cerebras, and anything detected as a non-local backend) the semaphore is skipped — the upstream handles parallelism natively and serialising artificially would throttle you. This is automatic; you don't need to configure it.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `HOUTINI_LM_ENDPOINT_URL` | `http://localhost:1234` | Base URL of the OpenAI-compatible API. Legacy alias: `LM_STUDIO_URL`. |
| `HOUTINI_LM_API_KEY` | *(none)* | Bearer token for authenticated endpoints. Legacy aliases: `LM_STUDIO_PASSWORD`, `LM_PASSWORD`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. |
| `HOUTINI_LM_MODEL` | *(auto-detect)* | Model identifier — leave blank to use whatever's loaded. Legacy alias: `LM_STUDIO_MODEL`. |
| `HOUTINI_LM_PROVIDER` | *(auto-detect)* | Force provider-specific handling. Set to `openrouter` for OpenRouter attribution headers, `reasoning.exclude`, and no inference serialisation. Otherwise auto-detected from the endpoint URL. |
| `HOUTINI_LM_CONTEXT_WINDOW` | `100000` | Fallback context window if the API doesn't report it. Legacy alias: `LM_CONTEXT_WINDOW`. |

## CLI delegation backend

The CLI backend delegates inference to locally-installed AI CLIs (Codex, Claude) instead of an OpenAI-compatible HTTP server. Each CLI runs in agentic-lockdown mode — read-only, single-response — so it cannot edit files or run mutating commands. Prompts are passed inline; the CLIs return one response and exit.

### Activation

Set `HOUTINI_LM_BACKEND` to choose the backend:

| Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| *(unset)* or `openai-compat` | OpenAI-compatible path (default, existing behaviour). A CLI config file is ignored even if present. |
| `cli` | CLI backend. Requires `HOUTINI_LM_CLI_CONFIG` — the server exits with a fatal error if it is missing. |
| `auto` | CLI backend if `HOUTINI_LM_CLI_CONFIG` is set; otherwise OpenAI-compatible path. |

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | What it does |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `HOUTINI_LM_BACKEND` | no | `openai-compat` (default) \| `cli` \| `auto` |
| `HOUTINI_LM_CLI_CONFIG` | when `cli` | Filesystem path to the JSON pool config file (absolute recommended; relative paths are resolved against the server's working directory). |
| `HOUTINI_LM_ALERT_WEBHOOK` | no | URL to POST `{ profile, provider, kind: "auth", ts }` on auth failures. |
| `HOUTINI_LM_PROFILE` | no | Pin a single profile by id — used verbatim with **no failover** (CLI backend only). The per-call `model` tool parameter takes precedence over it. `HOUTINI_LM_MODEL` remains a soft default: pool-based capability routing and failover still apply when only `HOUTINI_LM_MODEL` is set. |

Quick-start example:

```bash
claude mcp add houtini-lm \
  -e HOUTINI_LM_BACKEND=cli \
  -e HOUTINI_LM_CLI_CONFIG=/home/you/.houtini/cli-config.json \
  -- npx -y @houtini/lm
```

### Pool config (`HOUTINI_LM_CLI_CONFIG`)

The config file is a JSON object with a `profiles` array and an optional `defaults` block. A working 2-profile example (codex + claude) lives at [`docs/examples/cli-config.example.json`](docs/examples/cli-config.example.json).

**Top-level fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `profiles` | array | One entry per CLI subscription. Required, non-empty. |
| `defaults.timeoutMs` | number | Per-call subprocess timeout in ms (default 180000). |
| `defaults.cooldownMs` | number | How long a rate-limited profile sits out before re-entering the pool (default 60000). |

**Profile fields:**

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `id` | string | — | Unique identifier used for overrides and logs. Required. |
| `provider` | string | — | `codex` \| `claude` \| `llm` \| `custom`. Required. |
| `bin` | string | — | Executable name or absolute path (e.g. `codex`, `/usr/local/bin/claude`). Required. |
| `model` | string | — | Model identifier passed to the CLI (e.g. `gpt-5.4-codex`, `sonnet`). Required. |
| `configHome` | string | — | Path to isolate this profile's auth credentials (see multi-subscription below). |
| `capabilities` | array | `[]` | Task types this profile handles: `code` \| `chat` \| `analysis` \| `embedding`. Profiles with no matching capability for a task are reachable only via explicit override. Note: `embedding` is accepted by the validator but CLI profiles cannot serve embeddings — it is not useful for CLI routing. |
| `contextWindow` | number | — | Reported context window in tokens (informational). |
| `concurrency` | number | `1` | Max simultaneous in-flight calls on this profile. |
| `weight` | number | `1` | **Reserved** — parsed and validated but not used in v1 selection. Selection is capability-score then least-recently-used; `weight` has no effect. |
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Set to `false` to exclude a profile without removing it. |

**Custom-provider extras** (provider `custom` only):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `argvTemplate` | string[] | Full argument list passed to the subprocess. Used in v1. |
| `promptVia` | `stdin` \| `arg` | How the prompt is delivered. Used in v1. |
| `parse` | `text` \| `json` | **Reserved** — parsed and validated but not used in v1. The custom adapter returns trimmed stdout unconditionally. |
| `jsonPath` | string | **Reserved** — parsed and validated but not used in v1. The custom adapter does not extract from JSON. |

### Multi-subscription spreading

Each profile's `configHome` isolates that CLI's auth so you can spread calls across multiple subscriptions:

- **codex** — sets `CODEX_HOME` to `configHome`.
- **claude** — sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` to `configHome`.

> **Gemini is intentionally NOT supported via the CLI backend:** Google deprecated consumer-subscription auth for the Gemini CLI on 2026-06-18, so it now requires a developer/enterprise API key and yields no subscription token savings — reach Gemini via the OpenAI-compatible/LiteLLM path instead.

### Selection logic

1. **Explicit override** — if the per-call `model` parameter is set, that exact profile runs verbatim with no failover. `HOUTINI_LM_PROFILE` pins a profile by id at the process level (CLI backend only) — also verbatim, no failover. `HOUTINI_LM_MODEL` sets a process-level model default but does not pin a CLI profile — pool-based selection (capability → LRU) still applies unless the per-call `model` param or `HOUTINI_LM_PROFILE` overrides it.
2. **Capability scoring** — among available profiles, those whose `capabilities` include the current task type score higher (boosted further for `codex`-family profiles on code tasks and large-context profiles on analysis tasks).
3. **Round-robin / LRU tie-break** — equally-scored profiles rotate by least-recently-used.
4. **Automatic failover** — on rate-limit (429) or timeout the profile enters cooldown and the next candidate is tried. Auth failures immediately block the profile (see below).

### Agentic lockdown

All CLIs are invoked in read-only, single-response mode so they cannot edit files or run mutating commands:

| Provider | Flag |
|----------|------|
| codex | `exec -s read-only` |
| claude | `--permission-mode plan` |

Prompts pass all content inline. The CLIs return one response and exit.

### Auth failures

When a CLI exits with an auth error (401/403 or matching error text):

1. Logged to stderr as `[houtini-lm][AUTH] profile "<id>" (<provider>) auth-blocked`.
2. Surfaced in the tool response so the caller sees it.
3. The profile is marked auth-blocked — this is **sticky**. The profile does not auto-recover; fix the credentials and restart the server.
4. If `HOUTINI_LM_ALERT_WEBHOOK` is set, a POST is sent immediately: `{ profile, provider, kind: "auth", ts }`.

## Compatible endpoints

Works with anything that speaks the OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` API:

| What | URL | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) | `http://localhost:1234` | Default, zero config. Rich metadata via v0 API. |
| [Ollama](https://ollama.com) | `http://localhost:11434` | Set `HOUTINI_LM_ENDPOINT_URL`. Thinking models (qwen3, deepseek-r1) handled transparently — reasoning is captured from Ollama's `delta.reasoning` channel and the output budget is inflated automatically so small thinking models don't return empty bodies. |
| [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) | `https://openrouter.ai/api` | 300+ models from one endpoint. Auto-detected — sends attribution headers, uses `reasoning.exclude` for thinking models, retries 429/5xx with jittered backoff, parallel requests allowed. |
| [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai) | `http://localhost:8000` | Native OpenAI API |
| [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) | `http://localhost:8080` | Server mode |
| [DeepSeek](https://platform.deepseek.com) | `https://api.deepseek.com` | 28c/M input tokens |
| [Groq](https://groq.com) | `https://api.groq.com/openai` | ~750 tok/s |
| [Cerebras](https://cerebras.ai) | `https://api.cerebras.ai` | ~3000 tok/s |
| Any OpenAI-compatible API | Any URL | Set URL + password |

## Streaming and timeouts

All inference uses Server-Sent Events streaming. Tokens arrive incrementally. Since v2.9.0, houtini-lm sends MCP progress notifications on every streamed chunk — including during the thinking phase for reasoning models — which resets the SDK's 60-second client timeout. A 5-minute soft timeout acts as a safety net so a genuinely wedged connection can't hold a tool call open indefinitely; as long as tokens keep flowing, the per-chunk progress keeps the client side alive up to that ceiling.

If the connection stalls (no new tokens for an extended period), you get a partial result instead of a timeout error. The footer shows `TRUNCATED` when this happens, and the quality metadata flags it so Claude knows to treat the output with appropriate caution.

## Architecture

```
index.ts          Main MCP server - tools, streaming, session tracking
model-cache.ts    SQLite-backed model profile cache (sql.js / WASM)
                  Auto-profiles models via HuggingFace API at startup
                  Persists to ~/.houtini-lm/model-cache.db

Inference:        POST /v1/chat/completions  (OpenAI-compatible, works everywhere)
Model metadata:   GET  /api/v0/models        (LM Studio, falls back to /v1/models)
Embeddings:       POST /v1/embeddings        (OpenAI-compatible)
```

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/houtini-ai/lm.git
cd lm
npm install
npm run build
npm run shakedown    # end-to-end self-test + benchmark
```
